Clicking on a product image redirects to a detailed product page where users can view more information and add the product to their cart.
Cart and Review:

The Contact Us page allows users to give reviews of the products.

HTML and CSS Code
The HTML code structure includes sections for the navigation bar, image container, product grid, search bar, and footer.
CSS styles are applied to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design:
       * Flexbox is used for the navigation bar and newsletter form alignment.
       * Grid layout is used for displaying the products.
       * Hover effects are implemented for product images and navigation links.
       * Media queries are used to ensure the website is responsive on different screen sizes.
JavaScript functions (showSearch and closeSearch) control the display of the search bar.
Overall, the website is designed to provide a seamless shopping experience for customers, from browsing products to subscribing to newsletters for updates.
